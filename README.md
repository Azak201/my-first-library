ğŸ“š C Standard Library Recreation â€“ Custom Utility Library (Libft)
As part of my foundational C programming journey, I developed a full-featured utility library from scratch, mirroring and extending key functions of the C standard library. This project was built in pure C and includes:

ğŸ”¹ Character & String Manipulation: ft_strlen, ft_strchr, ft_strncmp, ft_strjoin, ft_substr, etc.
ğŸ”¹ Memory Functions: ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_calloc, ft_bzero, and others.
ğŸ”¹ Custom I/O: ft_printf (partial implementation of printf), ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd, etc.
ğŸ”¹ Linked List Utilities: Full bonus support including ft_lstnew_bonus, ft_lstadd_back_bonus, ft_lstmap_bonus, etc.
ğŸ”¹ Line Reader: get_next_line for reading input one line at a time.
ğŸ”¹ Integer Conversion & Math Helpers: ft_atoi, ft_itoa, and number formatting functions like ft_putnbr, ft_puthex, ft_putp.

ğŸ”§ Key Skills Gained:
â€¢ Deep understanding of memory management
â€¢ Manual string manipulation and buffer handling
â€¢ Data structures (linked lists)
â€¢ Modular and reusable code design

This project served as a foundation for further system-level programming and was a milestone in mastering C.
